Worldwide, the prevalence of obesity has reached epidemic proportions. The global obesity epidemic continues its relentless advance, currently affecting >2 billion people.
Over the last decade, 227 genetic variants involved in different biological pathways and distortion of the normal microbial balance have been associated with obesity and other metabolic diseases.
Exponential growth of biomedical literature has supposed a challenge for professionals to keep up with the lasts findings. Moreover, to find connections between different topics or disciplines has become even more difficult for the scientific community. In recent decades, the use of the data mining has been proposed to glean useful insights, discovering novel patterns, relationships and trends contained within the documents.
Text mining techniques were applied from the biomedical literature, specifically PubMed abstracts, in order to develop an interactive web application, METAVOLIKOS, to study the relationship of genes and intestinal microbiome in patients with obesity and other metabolic diseases. 
Concretely, the relationship between terms was studied through latent semantic analysis and subsequent cosine similarity. 
The work pipeline will be integrated into the development of the web application using the Shiny package of R.
A relationship has been inferred from publications on metabolic diseases where articles that include the term “Obesity” or explicitly the related gene or bacteria are not necessarily included. So, this work shows how latent semantic analysis can shed light to create new research hypotheses. 
METAVOLIKOS is a text mining application that is easily adaptable and usable by bench scientists, which inspires to develop new research lines.
